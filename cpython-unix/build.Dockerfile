# libc6-dev:i386 pulls in 32-bit system libraries to enable cross-compiling
# to i386.
#
# libffi-dev and zlib1g-dev are present so host Python (during cross-builds)
# can build the ctypes and zlib extensions. So comment in build-cpython.sh
# for more context.
#
# patchelf is needed by Python build to muck with rpath.
#
# Compression packages are needed to extract archives.
#
# Various other build tools are needed for various building.
